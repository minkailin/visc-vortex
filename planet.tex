\section{Vortex formation at planetary gap edges in layered
  discs}\label{disc-planet} 
The previous simulations, while necessary to isolate the effect of 
viscosity on the linear RWI, has the disadvantage that the radially
structured viscosity profile may act to source radial disc structure
in the non-linear regime. In this section, we employ a radially smooth
viscosity profile and use 
disc-planet interaction to
create the disc structure required for instability. We therefore expect viscosity to only
act as a damping mechanism. 

Vortex formation at gap edges is seen in many  
2D and 3D hydrdynamical simulations of giant planets in low viscosity discs 
\citep{valborro07,lin10,lin11a,lin12}. The fact that this is due to
the RWI has been explicitly verified through linear stability
analysis of planetary gap profiles produced from 2D simulations
\citep{valborro07,lin10}. Here, we simulate gap-opening giant planets
in 3D discs where the kinematic viscosity varies with height above the
disc midplane. Our numerical experiments are similar in spirit to
those performed by \cite{pierens10}, but our focus here is gap
stability in a layered disc. 
 
\subsection{Radially smooth viscosity profile for disc-planet
  interaction}\label{planet_visc_mode} 
Using the same notation as \S\ref{visc_model}, we impose a viscosity
profile $\hat{\nu}$ such that 
\begin{align}\label{planet_visc_profile}
  \hat{\nu}\Sigma_i(R)=
  \hat{\nu}_0\left[1+Q(\psi)\right]\Sigma_i(r_0)   
\end{align}
We have set the dimensionless argument in Eq. \ref{step} to
$\zeta=\psi$. Recall $\psi=\pi/2-\theta$ is the angular height away from the midplane. 
The viscosity increases from its floor value $\hat{\nu}_0$ by a factor
$A_\nu$ for $\psi > \zeta_\nu$. So the viscous layer is 
a wedge in the meridional plane, which conveniently fits into our
spherical grid. We set the floor viscosity $\hat{\nu}_0=2.5\times 10^{-7}$. 
The angluar thickness of the viscosity transition is fixed to $\Delta\zeta_\nu =
0.2h$. Fig. \ref{planet_visc2d} gives an example of this 
viscosity profile. %We will quote the thickness of the viscous layer as a 
%percentage of the entire $\theta$ domain size.

  \caption{Example of the `wedge' viscosity profile
    imposed in disc-planet simulations
    (Eq. \ref{planet_visc_profile}).  
    For a disc with constant aspect ratio, as chosen here, the viscous
    layer occupies a constant number of scale heights across the
    radial range. This specific plot corresponds to case P1, so the
    viscous layer (yellow-white colours) always occupies the uppermost
    $H$ at each cylindrical radius. 
    The solid line
    delineates the upper boundary of the computational domain.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Disc-planet simulations} 
We simulate locally isothermal discs with constant aspect-ratio
$h=0.05$ (by choosing $q=1$), vertical extent $n_h=3$ scale-heights 
and radial extent $[\rin,\rout]=[0.4,2.5]r_0$. Initially the surface density is smooth
($A=1$) with zero meridional velocity ($v_r=v_\theta=0$). 
%cylindrical radial velocity is given by
%Eq. \ref{init_vr}. 
The standard resolution is $(N_r, N_\theta,
N_\phi)=(256, 32n_h, 768)$, corresponding to $6,\,32,\,6$ 
cells per $H$ along the $r,\theta,\phi$ directions at the reference
radius. We apply a damping rate $\hat{\gamma}=2$ with the reference
velocity field $\bm{v}_\mathrm{ref}=(0,0,v_\phi)$ in spherical
co-ordinates.   

We insert into the disc a planet of mass  
$M_p=10^{-3}M_*$, which corresponds to a Jupiter mass planet if
$M_*=M_{\sun}$. The softening length adopted for the planet potential is
$\epsilon_p=0.5r_h$. The planet potential is switched on 
smoothly over $t\in[0,10]P_0$. We note that the disc can be considered
as two-dimensional for gap-opening giant planets, because the Hill
radius $r_h$ exceeds the local scale-height $H_0$ ($r_h/H_0\simeq1.4$
in our cases).   

We remark that the above choice of physical and numerical parameter
values are typical for global disc-planet simulations
\citep[e.g.][]{valborro06,mignone12}.   


\subsubsection{Runs} 
The fiducial case P0 has $A_\nu=1$ so there is no viscous layer, thus
$\hat{\nu}\sim 10^{-7}$ ($\alpha\sim 10^{-4}$) everywhere. Vortex
formation is then expected because the typical viscosity
value adopted for disc-planet simulations, $\hat{\nu}\sim 10^{-5}$ or
$\alpha\sim 10^{-3}$, is known to surpress vortex formation in 2D
\citep{valborro07, mudryk09}. 
For case P0.5 and P1 we set $A_\nu=100$ with transition angle $\zeta_\nu=2.5h$ and
$2h$, respectively. Thus the viscous layer with $\hat{\nu}\sim10^{-5}$
($\alpha\sim10^{-2}$) occupies the uppermost $0.5H$ and $H$ of the vertical
domain. %vortex formation is not expected to occur for such high
        %viscosity values. 
We also consider case P0R, in which we restart case P0 from 
$t=100P_0$ but with the layered viscosity profile of case P1. 

%also have additional runs for testing. these use n_h=2 for speed

\subsection{Results}
Table \ref{planet_sims} summarises the disc-planet simulations. 
We focus on vortex-formation at the outer gap edge. 
The non-axisymmetric mode amplitude in the last column was 
averaged over the shell $r\in[1.3,1.6]r_0$ and over time 
$t\in[150,200]P_0$. We examine the $m=1$ mode since 
for non-self-gravitating planetary gaps, if unstable, usually develop
a single vortex in quasi-steady state \citep{valborro07,lin10}.

\subsubsection{Density evolution}

Fig. \ref{jup0_3h} compares the time evolution of the midplane density
perturbation $\Delta\rho(z=0)$ for cases P0, P0.5 and P1. In 
all cases we observed the RWI with $m=4$ develops early on ($t\simeq20P_0$),
consistent with the limited effect of viscosity on the linear
instability, as found above.  

Comparing the no-layer case P0 to case P0.5 (viscous layer $0.5H$)
shows that a thin viscous layer has little effect on the
evolution of the unstable gap edge, except the vortex merging
time-scale is slightly altered. However, case P1 evolves quite
differently from case P0. While a single vortex does form at
$t\sim100P_0$, it is \emph{transient}, having disappeared at the end of
the simulation. The final $m=1$ amplitude is about 3 times smaller
than that in case P0 (Table \ref{planet_sims}). This result is
significant because the viscous layer of 
thickness $H$ only occupies $\sim4\%$ of the total column density
in case P1, but the vortex is still destroyed. This suggests that vortex
survival at planetary gap edges requires low effective viscosity
throughout the vertical fluid column.

\subsubsection{Kinetic energy density}
Here we examine the $m=1$ component of the kinetic energy
density, $W_1$. Specifically we compare the no-layer case P0, layered
case P1 and case P0R which is case P0 resumed from $t=100P_0$ with a
viscous layer. Fig. \ref{pdisk_kerz_cases_planet} shows the evolution of
this quantity averaged over the outer gap edge. For each case we
average $W_1$ over the disc bulk and the atmosphere, and plot them
separately in the figure. 

The $m=1$ component does not emerge from the linear instability, but is a
result of non-linear vortex merging. 
Fig. \ref{pdisk_kerz_cases_planet} shows that merging is accelerated
by a viscous layer: the single vortex appears at $t\sim70P_0$ for case
P1 but only forms at $t\sim120P_0$ for case P0. Also note for all
cases, $W_1$ in the disc bulk (thick lines) is similar to that in the
disc atmosphere (thin lines), implying the $m=1$ disturbance
(i.e. the vortex) evolves two-dimensionally. We checked that this is
consistent with the Froude number $Fr\equiv|Ro|H/z < 1 $ away from the
midplane \citep{barranco05,oishi09}. 

%check froud number is
%less than 1

Case P0R shows that introducing a viscous layer eventually destroys
the vortex. Now, the local viscous timescale $t_\nu\equiv
H^2/\nu\gtrsim 16P_0$ so on short timescales after introducing the 
viscous layer ($t=100P_0$), vortex-merging proceeds in case P0R
similarly to case P0 ($t\in[100,110]P_0$). However, $W_1$ decays after
$t>110P_0$ and evolves towards that for case P1. We expect viscosity
to damp the $m=1$ disturbance in the disc atmosphere between
$t\in[110,200]P_0$ because this corresponds to $\sim 6 t_\nu$, but it
appears that the disturbance in the disc bulk is also damped out: the
evolution remains two-dimensional.

    but was simulated with a viscous layer of thickness
