\section{Vortex formation at planetary gap edges in layered
  discs}\label{disc-planet} 
The previous simulations, while necessary to isolate the effect of 
viscosity on the linear RWI, has the disadvantage that the radially
structured viscosity profile can act to source radial disc structure
in the non-linear regime. In this section, we employ a radially smooth
viscosity profile and use 
disc-planet interaction to
create the disc structure required for instability. Then we expect viscosity to only
act as a damping mechanism. 

Vortex formation at gap edges is a standard result in 
2D and 3D hydrodynamical simulations of giant planets in low viscosity discs 
\citep{valborro07,lin10,lin11a,lin12}. The fact that this is due to
the RWI has been explicitly verified through linear stability
analysis %of planetary gap profiles produced from 2D simulations
\citep{valborro07,lin10}. Here, we simulate gap-opening giant planets
in 3D discs where the kinematic viscosity varies with height above the
disc midplane. Our numerical setup is similar to
those that in \cite{pierens10}, but our interest is gap
stability in a layered disc. 
 
\subsection{Radially smooth viscosity profile for disc-planet
  interaction}\label{planet_visc_mode} 
Using the same notation as \S\ref{visc_model}, we impose a viscosity
profile $\hat{\nu}$ such that 
\begin{align}\label{planet_visc_profile}
  \hat{\nu}\Sigma_i(R)=
  \hat{\nu}_0\left[1+Q(\psi)\right]\Sigma_i(r_0)   
\end{align}
We have set the dimensionless argument in Eq. \ref{step} to
$\zeta=\psi$. Recall $\psi=\pi/2-\theta$ is the angular height away from the midplane. 
Viscosity increases from its floor value $\hat{\nu}_0$ by a factor
$A_\nu$ for $\psi > \zeta_\nu$. So the viscous layer is 
a wedge in the meridional plane, which conveniently fits into our
spherical grid.  
The angular thickness of the viscosity
transition is fixed to $\Delta\zeta_\nu =
0.2h$. Fig. \ref{planet_visc2d} gives an example of this  
viscosity profile. 

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/pdisk_visc2d_planet}
  \caption{Example of the viscosity profile
    imposed in disc-planet simulations
    (Eq. \ref{planet_visc_profile}).  
    For a disc with constant aspect ratio, the viscous
    layer occupies a constant number of scale heights across the
    radial range. This specific plot corresponds to case P1, so the
    viscous layer (yellow-white colours) always occupies the uppermost
    $H$ at each cylindrical radius. 
    The solid line delineates the upper boundary of the computational
    domain. 
    \label{planet_visc2d}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Disc-planet simulations} 
We simulate locally isothermal discs with constant aspect-ratio
$h=0.05$ (by choosing $q=1$), vertical extent $n_h=3$ scale-heights 
and radial extent $[\rin,\rout]=[0.4,2.5]r_0$. Initially the surface density is smooth
($A=1$) with zero meridional velocity ($v_r=v_\theta=0$). 
%cylindrical radial velocity is given by
%Eq. \ref{init_vr}. 
The standard resolution is $(N_r, N_\theta,
N_\phi)=(256, 96, 768)$, corresponding to $6,\,32,\,6$ 
cells per $H$ along the $r,\theta,\phi$ directions at the reference
radius. We apply a damping rate $\hat{\gamma}=2$ with the reference
velocity field $\bm{v}_\mathrm{ref}=(0,0,v_\phi)$ in spherical
co-ordinates.   

We insert into the disc a planet of mass  
$M_p=10^{-3}M_*$, which corresponds to a Jupiter mass planet if
$M_*=M_{\sun}$. The softening length for the planet potential is
$\epsilon_p=0.5r_h$. The planet potential is switched on 
smoothly over $t\in[0,10]P_0$. We note that the disc can be considered
as two-dimensional for gap-opening giant planets, because the Hill
radius $r_h$ exceeds the local scale-height $H$ ($r_h/H\simeq1.4$
in our cases).   

We remark that, apart from the viscosity prescription, the above
choice of physical and numerical parameter values are typical for
global disc-planet simulations \citep[e.g.][]{valborro06,mignone12}.

\subsection{Results}
Table \ref{planet_sims} summarizes the disc-planet simulations. 
%\subsubsection{Runs} 
The main simulations to be discussed are cases P0 --- P1, with a floor
viscosity of $\hat{\nu}_0=2.5\times10^{-7}$. 
The fiducial run P0 has $A_\nu=1$, i.e. no viscous layer, so that $\alpha\sim 10^{-4}$ everywhere. 
The more typical viscosity value adopted for disc-planet simulations,
$\hat{\nu}\sim 10^{-5}$ or $\alpha\sim 10^{-3}$, is known to suppress vortex formation
\citep{valborro07, mudryk09}. Thus vortex formation is expected in 
case P0. For case P0.5 and P1 we set $A_\nu=100$ with transition angle $\zeta_\nu=2.5h$ and
$2h$, respectively, so the viscous layer with $\alpha\sim10^{-2}$ occupies the uppermost $0.5H$ and $H$ of the vertical
domain. Case P0R is case P0 restarted from 
$t=100P_0$ with the layered viscosity profile of case P1.

Fig. \ref{jup0_3h} compares the time evolution of the midplane density
perturbation $\delta\rho(z=0)$ for cases P0, P0.5 and P1. In 
all cases we observed the RWI with $m=4$ develops early on ($t\simeq20P_0$),
consistent with the limited effect of viscosity on the linear
instability, as found above. 
The no-layer case P0 and layered case P0.5 (viscous layer of $0.5H$)
behave similarly, showing that a thin viscous layer has little effect
on the evolution of the unstable gap edge, at least over the
simulation time-scale of $200P_0$.  

%We find, at the outer gap edge
%$\mathrm{max}(a_1)\sim 0.25$ for both cases, but the vortex in case
%P0.5 decays to $a_1\sim$  

Case P1 evolves quite
differently from case P0. While a single vortex does form at
$t\sim100P_0$, it is \emph{transient}, having disappeared at the end of
the simulation for P1. The final $m=1$ amplitude is about 3 times smaller
than that in case P0 (Table \ref{planet_sims}). This result is
significant because the upper viscous layer in case P1, of 
thickness $H$, only occupies $\sim4\%$ of the total column density, 
%since its hydrostatic
but the vortex is still destroyed. This suggests that vortex
survival at planetary gap edges requires low effective viscosity
throughout the vertical fluid column.

\subsubsection{Kinetic energy density}%prob replace with nu_floor=1d-6,
                                %amp=10 sims
Here, we compare the $m=1$ component of the kinetic energy density
($W_1$)  between the no-layer case P0, layered
case P1 and case P0R which is P0 resumed from $t=100P_0$ with a
viscous layer. Fig. \ref{pdisk_kerz_cases_planet} shows 
$W_1(t)$ averaged over the outer gap edge. For each case we
average $W_1$ over the disc bulk and the atmosphere, and plot them
separately in the figure. 

The $m=1$ component does not emerge from the linear instability, but is a
result of non-linear vortex merging. 
Fig. \ref{pdisk_kerz_cases_planet} shows that merging is accelerated
by a viscous layer: the single vortex appears at $t\sim70P_0$ for case
P1 but only forms at $t\sim120P_0$ for case P0. Also note for all
cases, $W_1$ in the disc bulk (thick lines) is similar to that in the
disc atmosphere (thin lines), implying the $m=1$ disturbance
(i.e. the vortex) evolves two-dimensionally. We checked that this is
consistent with the Froude number $Fr\equiv|Ro|H/z < 1 $ away from the
midplane \citep{barranco05,oishi09}. 

%check froud number is
%less than 1

Case P0R shows that introducing a viscous layer eventually destroys
the vortex. The local viscous timescale is $t_\nu\equiv
H^2/\nu\gtrsim 16P_0$, so on short timescales after introducing the 
viscous layer ($t=100P_0$), vortex-merging proceeds in case P0R
similarly to case P0 ($t\in[100,110]P_0$). However, $W_1$ decays for
$t>110P_0$ and evolves towards that of case P1. We expect viscosity
to damp the $m=1$ disturbance in the disc atmosphere between
$t\in[110,200]P_0$ because this corresponds to $\sim 6 t_\nu$, but 
the disturbance in the disc bulk is also damped out: the evolution
remains two-dimensional.    

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/pdisk_kerz_cases_planet_m1}
  \caption{Evolution of the $m=1$ component of kinetic energy density,
    averaged over $r\in[1.2,1.6]r_0$. This average
    is split into that taken over disc bulk ($z\in[0,2]H$, thick
    lines) and the disc atmosphere ($z\in[2,3]H$, thin lines). Case P0
    has no viscous layer (solid) and case P1 has a viscous layer in
    $z\in[2,3]H$ (dashed). Case P0R (dotted) is identical to P0 up to $t=100P_0$,
    but was simulated for $t>100P_0$ with a viscous layer of thickness
    $H$.  
\label{pdisk_kerz_cases_planet}}
\end{figure}

We emphasize the kinetic energy is dominated by horizontal
motions, with $\mathrm{max}(|v_z|/|\bm{v}|) < 0.03$ at the outer
gap edge ($r\in[1.2,1.6]r_0$). Vertical motions are well sub-sonic. When averaged
over $z\in[0,2]H$ and $z\in[2,3]H$, the vertical Mach number
$M_z\equiv|v_z|/c_s=0.05,\,0.08$ (P0), $M_z=0.04,\,0.05$ (P0R) and
$M_z=0.05,0.06$ (P1), respectively. %That is, $|v_z|$
%increases with height, but the difference between $v_z$ in the disc
%atmosphere and that near the midplane diminishes when viscosity is
%present in the former. 

\subsubsection{Potential vorticity}
We examine the PV evolution for case P0R in
Fig. \ref{jup0_3h_visc_restart_vorten}, but  
to highlight the vortices, which are positive (negative)
density (vertical vorticity) perturbations, we show the inverse PV
perturbation, $\delta\eta_z^{-1}\equiv\eta_z(t=0)/\eta_z - 1$. As
noted above, a single vortex still forms  
despite introducing a viscous layer at $t=100P_0$. However, it
decays rapidly compared to case P0. %The vortex elongates, 
%producing a `tail' ($t=160P_0$), and eventually the vortex core
%disappears altogether.
The region with $\delta\eta_z^{-1}>0$ (i.e. the vortex) elongates and 
shifts outward from $R\simeq 1.38r_0$ at $t=140P_0$ to $R\simeq1.5r_0$
at $t=200P_0$, by which the vortex has disappeared. (A similar
evolution was observed for case P1.) The vortex is stretched
azimuthally much more than radially. This is not surprising since the
imposed viscosity profile is axisymmetric. The important point is
that viscosity is only large near the disc surface, but still has a
significant effect on the vortex. 

%azimuthal PV perturbation is consistently more shallow with visc
%layer introduced. 
%delta PV - 1 \sim -0.6 (P0R) at R \sim 1.4r_0
%delta PV - 1 \sim -0.7 (P0)  at R \sim 1.4r_0

\subsubsection{Resolution check}%prob just commentary
We repeated simulations P0 and P1 with resolution
$(N_r,N_\theta,N_\phi)=(512,96,1536)$, corresponding
to $12$ and $32$ cells per scale-height in $(r,\phi)$ and $\theta$,
respectively. We denote these runs as P0HR and P1HR below. 

We observe similar evolution in P0HR and P1HR as their standard
resolution versions. However, due to lower numerical diffusion, we
find stronger vortices in P0HR. Although the vortex in P1HR persisted
longer than the standard resolution run, it was still subject to rapid
decay in comparison with P0HR. At $t=200P_0$ we find 
the $m=1$ amplitude to be $a_1=0.29$ and $a_1=0.10$ at the outer gap
edge, respectively for P0HR and P1HR; a similar contrast as that
between P0 and P1. A weak over-density was still observed in
P1HR at $t=200P_0$, but it further decays to $a_1=0.06$ at $t=230P_0$
and there is no vortex. By contrast, P0HR was simulated to $t=250P_0$
and the vortex survived with little decay ($a_1=0.25$).   
  
Interestingly, we observe small-scale ($\lesssim H$) disturbances inside the
vortex in P0HR. This is shown in the left panel of  
Fig. \ref{HR_sims} in terms of the (inverse) PV perturbation. We
checked the density field remains smooth, so this small-scale structure is
due to vorticity variations. This is unlikely the elliptic instability
\citep{lesur09}, though, because the numerical resolution is still
insufficient for studying such instabilities; especially since the vortex is weak  with aspect ratio
$\sim 10$. Despite the disturbances, the vortex over-density in P0HR remains coherent until the
end of the simulation, possibly because the planet maintains the 
condition for RWI. On the other hand, the vortex in the layered-case
P1HR does not develop small-scale structure (Fig. \ref{HR_sims}, right
panel), yet it is destroyed by the end of the simulation.

\subsection{Additional simulations}% higher visc, strict isothermal 
Locally isothermal, low viscosity discs are vulnerable to the
so-called `vertical shear 
instability' because $\partial_z\Omega_i\neq 0$ \citep{nelson12}. 
\citeauthor{nelson12} employed a radial  resolution $\gtrsim 60$ cells
per $H$ to resolve this instability because it involves small radial
wavelengths ($\ll H$). Our numerical resolution is unlikely to capture
this instability. Nevertheless, we have performed additional
simulations designed to eliminate the vertical shear instability.   

\subsubsection{Larger floor viscosity}
We performed several simulations with $\hat{\nu}_0=10^{-6}$. A viscosity of
$\hat{\nu}\sim 10^{-6}$ is expected to damp the vertical shear 
instability \citep{nelson12}, while still permitting the gap-edge
RWI. Table \ref{planet_sims} summarizes
these cases with $A_\nu=10$ (`Pb' runs) and $A_\nu=100$ (`Pc' runs). 

In these simulations we find vortices eventually decay, even in the
no-layer case Pb0. For $A_\nu=10$, the layered cases Pb0.5 and Pb1 evolve
similarly Pb0: three vortices formed by $t\sim30P_0$, merging into two
vortices by $t\sim40P_0$, then finally into a single vortex by
$t\sim130P_0$, which subsequently decays. However, the final vortex
decays faster in the presence of a viscous layer. This is shown in
Fig. \ref{pdisk_kerz_cases_planet_hivisc}, which compares the $m=1$
kinetic energy density for case Pb0 and Pb1. The evolution only begins
to differ after the single-vortex has formed. 

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/pdisk_kerz_cases_nu6}
  \caption{Same as Fig. \ref{pdisk_kerz_cases_planet} but with
    floor viscosity $\hat{\nu}_0=10^{-6}$: cases Pb0 (solid, no viscous layer) and Pb1
    (dotted, viscous layer of $H$). The thick (thin) lines indicate
    $W_1$ averaged over $z\in[0,2]H$
    ($z\in[2,3]H$). 
    \label{pdisk_kerz_cases_planet_hivisc}}
\end{figure}


For $A_\nu=100$ (cases Pc0.5 and Pc1), we find the $m=2$ amplitude
dominated over $m=1$, so a single-vortex configuration never
forms. For both Pc0.5 and Pc1 the $m=2$ (two-vortex configuration)
amplitude decreases from $t\sim 50P_0$. For case Pc1, the vortices are
transient features and are entirely absent for $t\gtrsim80P_0$.  


\subsubsection{Strictly isothermal discs} 
We repeated simulations Pb0, Pb1 and Pc1 with a strictly isothermal
equation of state ($q=0$). These are summarised in Table
\ref{planet_sims_iso}. Fig. \ref{pdisk_kerz_cases_planet_iso} compares
their $m=1$ kinetic energy density evolution at the outer gap edge. Consistent with the
above simulations, a viscous layer causes a faster decay in this
quantity. Most interesting though, is that we found case Iso2 (with a viscous
layer of $\sim H$) only shows very weak non-axisymmetric perturbations
early on ($t\lesssim 50P_0$): vortex formation is suppressed. 


%and the end, vortices in all cases?

  \caption{Same as Fig. \ref{pdisk_kerz_cases_planet} but for strictly
    isothermal Iso0 (solid, no viscous layer so $\hat{\nu}\sim10^{-6}$), Iso1
    (dotted, viscous layer with $\hat{\nu}\sim10^{-5}$) and Iso2
    (dashed, viscous layer with $\hat{\nu}\sim10^{-4}$). The thick (thin) lines indicate
    $W_1$ averaged over $\tan{\psi}\in[0,2]h$
    ($\tan{\psi}\in[2,3]h$).
