\section{Non-axisymmmetric instability of artificial density bumps in
  layered discs}\label{density_bump} 
We first consider strictly isothermal discs ($q=0$) initialised with a
density bump ($A>1$). Our aim here
is to examine the effect of (layered) viscosity on the RWI 
\emph{through the linear perturbation}. 
In general a density bump in a viscous disc will undergo viscous
spreading \citep{lyndenbell74}, but we can circumvent this 
by choosing the viscosity profile $\nu$ and initial cylindrical radial
velocity $v_{Ri}$ appropriately. 
Although artificial, this setup avoids 
the simultaneous evolution of the density bump subject to
axisymmetric viscous spreading and growth of
non-axisymmetric disturbances; only the latter of which is our focus. 


\subsection{Viscous equilibria for a radially structured
  disc}\label{visc_eq}  
In choosing $\rho_i$ and $\Omega_i$, we neglected radial
velocities and viscous forces in the steady-state vertical and
cylindrical radial momentum equations (Eq. \ref{vert_balance} and
Eq. \ref{init_vphi}, respectively). This is standard practice for
accretion disc modelling \citep[e.g.][]{takeuchi02}.   

However, $v_{R}$ and $\nu$ cannot be ignored in the azimuthal
momentum equation. Indeed, if a steady-state is desired, then the
conservation of angular momentum in a viscous disc implies special
relations between the viscosity, cylindrical radial velocity and
density field. 

\subsubsection{Initial cylindrical radial velocity}
For axisymmetric flow with $\Omega=\Omega(R)$, the azimuthal momentum
equation reads  
\begin{align}\label{ang_mom_cons}
  R\rho v_R\frac{\p}{\p R}\left(R^2\Omega \right) = \frac{\p}{\p
    R}\left(R^3\rho\nu\frac{\p\Omega}{\p R}\right). 
\end{align}
Note that the viscous term due to vertical shear ($\partial_z\Omega$) 
is absent because in this experiment we are considering barotropic
discs. Assuming a steady state with $v_z=0$, mass
conservation (Eq. \ref{cont_eq}) implies that the mass flux  
$\dot{M}\equiv R\rho v_R$ is independent of $R$. In this case,
Eq. \ref{ang_mom_cons} can 
be integrated once to yield 
\begin{align}\label{temp}
  \dot{M}R^2\Omega = R^3\rho\nu\Omega^\prime + C(z) \quad \text{if $\p_R\dot{M}$} = 0, 
\end{align}
where $^\prime$ denotes $d/dR$ and $C(z)$ is an arbitrary function of
$z$. Eq. \ref{temp} motivates the simple choice
\begin{align}\label{init_vr} 
  v_{Ri} = \frac{\nu}{R}\frac{d\ln{\Omega_i}}{d\ln{R}} 
\end{align}
for the initial cylindrical radial velocity. Next, we choose the
viscosity profile $\nu$ to make $\dot{M}$ independent of
cylindrical radius.  

\subsubsection{Viscosity profile for a steady state}\label{visc_model}
If the initial conditions corresponds to a steady state, then
$R \rho_i v_{Ri}$ can only be a function of $z$. With $v_{Ri}$ chosen
by Eq. \ref{init_vr}, this implies 
$R\rho_i\nu\Omega_i^\prime/\Omega_i$ is only a function of $z$. We are
therefore free to choose the vertical dependence of viscosity.   

Let $\nu = \hat{\nu}r_0^2\Omega_k(r_0)$, where
$\hat{\nu}=\hat{\nu}(R,z)$ is a dimensionless function describing
the magnitude and spatial distribution of the axisymmetric kinetmatic
viscosity. We choose $\hat{\nu}$ such that   
\begin{align}\label{visc_profile}
  \hat{\nu}\rho_i(R,z)\frac{d\ln{\Omega_i}}{d\ln{R}} =
  \hat{\nu}_0\left[1+Q(z/H_0)\right]\rho_i(r_0,z)\left.\frac{d\ln{\Omega_i}}{d\ln{R}}\right|_{r_0}, 
\end{align}
where $\nu_0$ is a constant dimensionless floor viscosity and   
\begin{align}\label{step}
  Q(\zeta) = \frac{\left(A_\nu - 1\right)}{2}
  \left[  2 + \tanh{\left(\frac{\zeta - \zeta_\nu}{\Delta\zeta_\nu}\right)}
    %  \left. 
    - \tanh{\left(\frac{\zeta +
        \zeta_\nu}{\Delta\zeta_\nu}\right)}\right]
\end{align}
is a generic function describing a step of magnitude
$A_\nu-1$. The position and width of the step is described by
$\zeta_\nu$ and $\Delta\zeta_\nu$, respectively. 
In Eq. \ref{visc_profile} we have set the dimensionless co-ordinate
$\zeta=z/H_0$ where $H_0=H(r_0)$. %We have specified
%the kinematic viscosity directly, but 
We can translate $\hat{\nu}$ to an alpha viscosity 
using $\nu = \alpha c_s H$ \citep{shakura73} so that $\alpha =
\hat{\nu}/h^2$ at $R=r_0$.  This gives $\alpha\sim 10^{-2}$ for
$h=0.1$ and $\hat{\nu}=10^{-4}$. 

Eq. \ref{visc_profile} implies that at the fixed cylindrical radius
$R=r_0$, the dimensionless viscosity increases from $\hat{\nu} =
\hat{\nu}_0$ at the midplane to $\hat{\nu} = A_\nu\hat{\nu}_0$ for
$z > \zeta_\nu H_0$. An example of such a layered viscosity profile
profile is depicted in Fig. \ref{visc2d}.

    corresponds to case V2. The solid line

\end{figure}


\subsection{Simulations}
We consider discs with radial extent $[\rin,\rout]=[0.4,2.0]r_0$,
vertical extent $n_h=2$ scale-heights and aspect-ratio $h=0.1$ at
$R=r_0$. We use $(N_r, N_\theta,
N_\phi)=(256,64,512)$ grid points. 
The resolution at the reference radius is then
$16,\,32,\,8$ cells per scale-height in $(r,\theta,\phi)$ directions,
respectively. The planet potential is disabled for these runs
($M_p\equiv 0$). We apply a damping rate $\hat{\gamma}=1$ with the
reference velocity $\bm{v}_\mathrm{ref}=\bm{v}(t=0)$.     

The bump parameters are set to $A=1.25$ and $\Delta R = 0.05r_0$ for
all runs in this section. The spherical radial velocity is subject 
to random perturbations of magnitude $10^{-4}c_s$ 
a few time-steps after initialisation. 

\subsubsection{Inviscid run}
For reference we simulate an effectively inviscid disc, case B0,
with the viscosity parameters $\hat{\nu}_0=10^{-9}$ and $A_\nu = 1$.  
Thus viscosity is independent of $z$ at $R=r_0$.   
Inviscid setups similar to case B0 have previously been simulated
both in the linear and non-linear regimes  \citep{meheut12, lin13}. 
%So, %in addition to a control run, case B0 also serves to test the \pluto
%code in simulating the RWI.    

\subsubsection{Viscous runs}
In these runs the floor viscosity is 
$\hat{\nu}_0=10^{-6}$. The control run case V0 has $A_\nu =
1$. Thus, case V0 is the viscous version of case B0.  
We then consider models where the kinematic viscosity increases by
a factor $A_\nu=100$ for $z>\zeta_\nu H_0$ at the bump radius. We
choose $\zeta_\nu=1.5,\,1.0$ for cases V1 and V2, respecively.  This
gives a upper 
viscous layer of thickness $0.5H$ and $H$ at $R=r_0$. (See
Fig. \ref{visc2d} for a plot of the kinematic viscosity profile for case V2.) 
For case V1 and V2 the transition thickness is fixed to
$\Delta\zeta_\nu=0.2$.  
 
Finally, we consider a high viscosity run, case V3, 
with $\hat{\nu}_0=10^{-4}$ and $A_\nu=1$.  This is equivalent to
extending the viscous layer in case V1/V2 to the entire vertical
domain.  

\subsubsection{Linear growth rates and frequencies}
The present setup allows us to define a linear instability in the
usual way: exponential growth of perturbations measured with respect
to an axisymmetric steady equilibrium. A proper linear
stability analysis, including the full viscous stress tensor, is
beyond the scope of this paper, but we can nevertheless extract linear 
mode frequences from the non-linear simulations.  

The $m^\mathrm{th}$ Fourier component of the density field is  
\begin{align}
\hat{\rho}_m(r,\theta,t) \equiv \int_0^{2\pi} \rho(\bm{r},t)\exp{(-\ii
  m\phi)}d\phi. 
\end{align} 
The magnitude of a Fourier mode is measured by 
\begin{align} 
a_m(t)\equiv \frac{b_m(t)}{b_0(0)},\quad b_m(t)\equiv \avg{|\hat{\rho}_m|}_r,
\end{align} 
where $\avg{\cdot}_r$ denotes averaging over a spherical shell (to be
chosen later). 
The complex frequency $\sigma_m$ associated with the $m^\mathrm{th}$ component 
is defined through 
\begin{align}\label{sigma}
  \frac{\p\hat{\rho}_m}{\p t} \equiv -\ii\sigma_m\hat{\rho}_m. 
\end{align}
The time derivative in Eq. \ref{sigma} can be computed implicitly by 
Fourier-transforming the continuity equation \citep[as done
  in][]{lin13}. 

In a linear stability problem $\sigma_m$ is a constant eigenvalue. 
However, when extracted numerically from a non-linear simulation, 
we will generally obtain $\sigma_m=\sigma_m(r,\theta,t)$. Thus, we compute 
$\avg{\sigma_m}_r = m\omega_m + \ii q_m$    
where $\omega_m$ is the mode frequency and $q_m$ is the growth rate.
We normalise the linear frequencies by
$\Omega_0\equiv\Omega_i(r_0)\simeq\Omega_k(r_0)$. 

\subsection{Results}
Table \ref{artificial_bump} summarises the simulations presented in
this section. Linear mode frequencies are measured at 
$t=10P_0$ (when $|\delta\rho|\ll 1$) and averaged over 
$r\in[0.8,1.2]r_0$. The second set of measurements is made well into
the non-linear regime at $t=100P_0$. 
The minimum Rossby number is measured at
the midplane.

\subsubsection{Inviscid reference case}
Fig. \ref{bump0_bump1} 
shows the density fluctuation and Rossby number for
case B0. The dominant linear mode is $m=4$ with a growth rate
$0.2\Omega_0$, consistent with recent 3D linear calculations 
\citep{meheut12,lin13}. 
%Fig. \ref{bump0_bump1} shows that the
%linear phase consists of non-axisymmetric vorticity perturbations on
%either side of the density bump \citep{umurhan10}, i.e. vorticity
%waves propagating along the PV gradients.     
The non-linear outcome of the RWI is vortex formation
\citep{li00}. Four vortices develop initially, then 
merge on a dynamical timescale into  
a single vortex. Case B0 evolves similarly to previous simulations of
the RWI in an inviscid disc 
\citep[e.g.][where more detailed analyses are 
given]{meheut10,meheut12b}. This, together with the agreement with
linear calculations, demonstrates the ability of the \pluto
code to capture the RWI.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{The effect of a viscous layer}
We now examine viscous cases V0 --- V3. Recall  
from Table \ref{artificial_bump} that the viscous layer (with $
\hat{\nu}\sim10^{-4}$) occupies the uppermost $0\%,\,25\%,\,50\%$ and
$100\%$ of the vertical domain at $R=r_0$ for cases V0, V1, V2 and V3,
respectively.     

We first compare the viscous case V0 to the 
inviscid case B0. Table \ref{artificial_bump} shows that despite
increasing the viscosity by a factor of $10^3$, the change to the
linear mode frequencies are negligible. 
The value of $a_m$ and minimum Rossby number indicate that the final
vortex in V0 is only slightly weaker than that in B0. This is also
reflected in  Fig. \ref{bump0_bump1} (case B0) and the left most column of
Fig. \ref{vdamp0} (case V0). Case V0 develops a more elongated 
vortex with smaller $|\Delta\rho|$ than that in case B0. 
  
As we introduce and thicken the viscous layer from case V0 to V3, the dominant
linear mode remains at $m=4$ (Table \ref{artificial_bump}), but linear
growth rate does appreciably decrease (by $\sim 34\%$ from case V0 to
V3). However, these linear growth timescales  
are still $\sim P_0$. We thus have the important result that
viscosity (layered or not) does not significantly affect the linear
instability because the RWI grows dynamically even in the high
viscosity disc.

%The top row of Fig. \ref{vdamp0} shows that layered viscosity has a
%non-trivial effect on $\Delta\rho$ in the 
%non-linear regime. $|\Delta \rho|$ increases
%from case V0 to V1, then decreases from cases V1 to V3 (but aquires a
%more global distribution). The dominant azimuthal wavenumber also
%increase: vortices do not readily merge in case V2 and V3. 

The effect of layered viscosity in the non-linear regime is more
complicated. The bottom row of Fig. \ref{vdamp0} compares the Rossby number
associated with the over-densities. Thickening the viscous 
layer decreases the vortex aspect ratio. Since their widths remain
at $\sim 2H_0$, the vortices become smaller with increasing
viscosity. This is partly attributed to fewer vortex merging
events having occured as viscosity is increased. The merging of
two vortices usually leads to a larger but weaker vortex (smaller
$|Ro|$): if merging is resisted then each vortex may grow separately.  
Strangely, vortices become stronger  (more negative $Ro$) as viscosity
is increased. 

We compare  in Fig. \ref{bump_energy} the perturbed kinetic energy for 
cases B0, V0 and V1; which are all dominated by a single vortex in 
quasi-steady state. Thus we compute $W_1$, and
average it over the atmosphere ($\tan{\psi}\in[0,0.5]h$) and the 
disc bulk ($\tan{\psi}\in[0.5,2.0]h$). These averages are restricted
to the vortex region $r\in[0.8,1.2]r_0$. Note that for the layered
case V1, the distinction between disc bulk and atmosphere also
separates the low and high viscosity regions, respectively. 
%In an averaged sense, among 
%these runs case B0 has the lowest viscosity while case V1 has the
%highest.

Fig. \ref{bump_energy} displays only a minor difference between the
perturbed kinetic energy densities between the disc bulk and
atmosphere, even in case V1 where the viscosity in the two regions
differ by 100. This suggests that the perturbation evolves
two-dimensionally. The energy in case B0 and V0 are both subject to
slow decay. By contrast case V1, which has the highest viscosity in an
averaged sense, does \emph{not} show such a decay. This suggests that
viscosity could in fact strengthen the perturbation.

  \caption{The $m=1$ component of the kinetic energy density for

    disc bulk (thick lines) are plotted separately. 
    \label{bump_energy}}
\end{figure}


%We point out that the snapshots in
%Fig. \ref{vdamp0} are taken at the midplane, but  
%the influence of viscosity is apparent even when comparing case V1 to
%V0, i.e. when the viscous layer is confined near the upper
%boundary. This demonstrates the vertically-global nature of vortex
%formation through the RWI. Conditions near the disc
%surface should be expected to influence the instability throughout the
%fluid column.

\subsection{Order of magnitude comparison of timescales}
The observation of stronger vortical structures (more negative $Ro$
and smaller vortex aspect-ratio) with increasing
viscosity is unexpected, since one normally expects viscosity to
smooth out the flow. Here, we  attempt to make some sense of this
result by comparing key timescales relevant to the problem. 

The characteristic spatial scale of the background density bump and of
the instability is the local scale-height $H$, so the associated
viscous timescale is    
\begin{align}
  t_\nu = \frac{H^2}{\nu}\sim \frac{h^2}{\hat{\nu}\Omega}. 
\end{align}
The linear instability growth timescale is
\begin{align}
  t_\mathrm{RWI} = \frac{1}{\epsilon \Omega},
\end{align}
where $\epsilon$ is found from numerical simulations.   
The ratio of these timescales is
\begin{align}
  \frac{t_\nu}{t_\mathrm{RWI}} \sim \frac{\epsilon h^2}{\hat{\nu}}.
\end{align}
Table \ref{artificial_bump} indicates $\epsilon \sim 0.1$. 
Inserting $h=0.1$ and $\hat{\nu}=10^{-4}$ gives $t_\nu \sim 10
t_\mathrm{RWI}$. That is, viscosity damping is slower than linear
growth, even for the highest viscosity values we consider. 
The linear instability is therefore unaffected by viscosity. 

\cite{meheut13} argued that $t_\mathrm{RWI}$ is also the vortex
turn-over time $t_\mathrm{turn}$ when the instability saturates and
the linear phase terminates. Then 
$t_\nu\sim 10 t_\mathrm{turn}$, implying viscous effects 
are unimportant over one turn-over time. 
However, if we estimate a vortex turn-over time as $t_\mathrm{turn}
\sim 2\pi/|Ro|\Omega$ then $t_\nu\sim (h^2|Ro|/2\pi\hat{\nu})t_\mathrm{turn}$.  
Inserting $h=0.1,\,\hat{\nu}=10^{-4}$ and $|Ro|=0.25$ (case V3) gives 
$t_\nu \sim 4t_\mathrm{turn}$. Therefore, depending on the vortex shape, 
$t_\nu$ may not be much larger than $t_\mathrm{turn}$. 

In any case, our simulations span several local viscous timescales, 
$t_\mathrm{sim}\sim 10t_\nu $, so viscous damping should have taken
place, making the observation that $Ro$ becomes more negative as the 
viscous layer increases from case V0 to V3, a surprising
result. However, recall that we have chosen a stationary
viscosity profile consistent with a steady-state disc containing a
density bump. That is, the viscosity profile is radially
structured. We suggest that for such setups, viscosity attempts to
restore the initial disc profile, i.e. the initial PV minimum, acting
as a vorticity source.      

\subsection{Potential voritcity evolution}
The RWI is fundamentally associated with a PV minimum and the
instability is stronger for deeper minima \citep{li00}. We might
therefore expect deeper minima to correlate with stronger vortices. 
Consider the potential vorticity perturbation at the bump radius,
which we found to be  
\begin{align}\label{vortensity_pert}
  \left.\frac{\aziavg{\eta_z}(t=100P_0)}{\eta_z(t=0)}\right|_{R=r_0} - 1 = 
  \begin{cases}
    3.99  & \text{Case V0} \\
   3.03  & \text{Case V1} \\
   2.24  & \text{Case V2} \\
   1.71  & \text{Case V3} \\
  \end{cases}.
\end{align} 
(This value is 4.92 for the inviscid case B0.) The PV
perturbation is positive, thus the initial PV minimum is weakened
by the vortices \citep{meheut10}. This effect
diminishes with increasing viscosity. One contributing factor is 
that viscosity reduces the linear growth rate (Table
\ref{artificial_bump}), implying the linear 
instability saturates at a smaller amplitude \citep{meheut13}. This  
is expected to weaken the background axisymmetric structure to a lesser
extent.    

When viscosity is small, the viscous timescale is long compared to our
simulation timescale. In this case the non-linear evolution of the
instability---vortex formation---weakens the PV minimum with viscosity
playing no role. As we increase viscosity, the viscous timecale
associated with the density bump becomes shorter than our simulation
timescale. %deviations away from the initial bump is smoothed out by
            %viscosity 
This means that over the course of the simulation, our spatially-fixed
viscosity profile acts as a source to restore the original PV minimum. 

In essence, in the nonlinear regime there is competition 
between destruction of the background PV minimum by the 
vortices and reformation of the initial radial PV minimum by the
imposed viscosity profile. We except the latter to support vortex
formation, since the anti-cyclonic vortices are regions of local
vorticity minima.
