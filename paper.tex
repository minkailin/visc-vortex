\begin{abstract}
  Vortex formation through the so-called Rossby wave 
  instability (RWI) in protoplanetary discs has been invoked to play a
  role in planet formation theory, and has been suggested to explain
  the observation of large dust asymmetries in transitional discs.   
  However, whether or not vortex-formation operates in layered
  accretion discs, i.e. models of protoplanetary discs including dead zones, 
  has not been verified. As a first step to test the robustness of
  vortex-formation through the RWI in 3D discs, we present customized
  non-linear hydrodynamical
  simulations of 3D protoplanetary discs with an imposed kinematic
  viscosity that is height-dependent. Two types of numerical 
  experiments are performed:
  \begin{inparaenum}[(i)]
  \item non-axisymmetric instability of artificial
    density bumps;  
  \item vortex-formation at planetary gap edges.%; and 
%  \item vortex-formation in discs with a radial viscosity transition.
  \end{inparaenum}
   We find, from the first experiment, that the linear instability is largely unaffected by viscosity and remains dynamical. 
  However this is assuming that a steady-state viscous disc with a density bump can be constructed.  The disc-planet simulations 
  also show the initial development of vortices at gap edges, but in layered discs the vortex is transient and disappears 
  well into the non-linear regime. Our experimental results suggest that vortex
  formation via the RWI may require low viscosity throughout the 
  vertical extent of the disc.

Recent observations have revealed a class of transition discs ---
circumstellar discs which are dust poor in its inner regions ---  
with non-axisymmetric dust distributions in the outer disc
regions. One %some observations 
interpretation of such a non-axisymmetric structure is the presence of
a large-scale disc vortex, which is known to act as a dust trap
\citep{barge95}. Because of its occurence adjacent to the inner dust
hole, it has been suggested that such a vortex is a result of the
so-called Rossby wave instability: a hydrodynamical instability
associated with localized radial structures in thin discs.  

%2D results and relation to PPI

Modern studies of the RWI began with 2D linear stability analysis
\citep{lovelace99,li00}, which showed that a disc with localized
structure, such as a surface density enhancement over a
charactertistic lengthscale of the local scale-height, is unstable to
non-axisymmetric perturbations which grow on dynamical (orbital)
timescales. Early nonlinear 


%3D results
An important extension to the studies mentioned above is the
generalization of the RWI to 3D 
discs. Both nonlinear 3D hydrodynamic simulations 
\citep{meheut10,meheut12b,lin12b} and 3D linear calculations
\citep{umurhan10,meheut12,lin12,lin13} have been carried out. 
These studies reveal that the RWI is a 2D instability,
in that there is negligible difference between growth rates obtained
from 2D and 3D linear calculations. The associated density and
horizontal velocity perturbations have weak vertical dependence; and
vertical velocities are small. In nonlinear hydrodynamic simulations,
the vortices are columnar and extend throughout the vertical domain. 

%relevance to layered disc models
The RWI therefore appears to be a global instability in the direction
perpendicular to the disc midplane. Thus conditions away
from the disc midplane may have important effects on vortex-formation
via the RWI. For example, \cite{lin13a} only found linear
instability for certain upper disc boundary conditions. This issue is
relevant to protoplanetary disc models including `dead zones'. 

%the question
In layered protoplanetary disc models, accretion due to MRI turbulence
is small near the midplane (the dead zone), while MRI turbulence driven accretion
operaties near the disc surface \citep{gammie96,armitage11}. %also flemming, oishi, and the japanese guys  
If MRI-driven accretion can be modelled through an effective 
viscosity, this corresponds to a low-viscosity midplane and 
high-viscosity atmosphere. It is therefore valid to ask how such a
vertical disc structure would affect the RWI. 

This issue is partly motivated by viscous disc-planet
simulations show that the RWI only develops when the viscosity is
sufficiently small \citep{valborro07}%and edgar 'vertical structure of gaps'
A natural question one may pose is this: what if the effective 
viscosity near the midplane is sufficiently low for the RWI to
develop, but is too high away from the midplane? Does the
instability, and therefore vortex-formation, still take place? 

In this work we examine vortex formation through the RWI in
layered discs. As a first study to this problem, we take an
experimental approach through customized numerical hydrodynamic
simulations. We simulate 3D protoplanetary discs with an imposed
kinematic viscosity that varies with height above the disc
midplane. %because most simulations use a NS viscosity. full mri
          %simulation too expensive. comparison to previous 


%Apart from simplicitly, hydrodynamic models also allow 
%computations to be completed with reasonable cost. It is, however,
%still questionable as to whether or not an explicit viscosity 

%what we're going to do
%expensive 3D calcs. can't do parameter survey
%example sim demonstrating effect of layered disc
%highlight the potential importance of disc vertical structure
%need to know it can operate in typical disc conditions before
%invoking it to explain observations

%our approach to this problem will be through customized viscous disc
%simulations. we therefore utilize toy models in which we have full
%control.
