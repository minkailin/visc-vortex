\section{Summary and discussion}\label{summary}


\subsection{Caveats and outlooks}\label{caveats}
{\bf viscosity does not mimic mri turbulence (need spatial and
  temporal averaging)}

{\bf no magneto-elliptic instability}

{\bf static viscosity profile. but viscosity should depend on
  density. enhanced density may cause lower viscosity so perhaps vortex would
  survive? implement dynamic viscosity} 

%The most significant caveat of our model is, by far, the use of 
%a kinematic viscosity to model accretion.
