\section{Summary and discussion}\label{summary}
We have performed customised hydrodynamic simulations of vortex
formation in 3D viscous discs. We were motivated  
by the question of whether or not the Rossby wave instability, and
subsequent vortex formation, operates in layered accretion discs.  As
a first study, we adopted height-dependent kinematic viscosity
profiles, such that the disc midplane is of low viscosity ($\alpha\sim
10^{-4}$) and the disc atmosphere is of high viscosity ($\alpha\sim
10^{-2}$). 

We first examined the effect of layered viscosity on the linear
RWI. To do so, we set up viscous disc equilibria with a radial density
bump. 

\subsection{Caveats and outlooks}\label{caveats}
{\bf viscosity does not mimic mri turbulence (need spatial and
  temporal averaging)}

{\bf no magneto-elliptic instability}

{\bf static viscosity profile. but viscosity should depend on
  density. enhanced density may cause lower viscosity so perhaps vortex would
  survive? implement dynamic viscosity} 

%The most significant caveat of our model is, by far, the use of 
%a kinematic viscosity to model accretion.
