However,  one concern with these results is that there seems to be a
discrepancy between the effect of layered viscosity in disks with an artificial
bump and realistic models where a gap is opened by a planet. As outlined in
section 4.4 a simulation with a high viscosity layer and an artificial density
bump shows that vorticity increases for a larger upper viscous layer possibly
due to the artificial viscosity radial profile. I think this issue could be
addressed in Section 6 after the two sets of numerical simulations have been
presented. To try to identify why this behavior is present in the vortex
evolution with a prescribed radial viscosity profile, two models with the same
numerical setup and viscosity profile parameters with a density bump and a gap
introduced by the planet could be compared directly.  This comparison could
confirm the hypothesis that the viscosity profile supports the grow of
vorticity if the same effect is reproduced in the simulation that includes the
interaction with a planet.

I have listed below several minor issues that should be changed in the
manuscript to describe the models and results comprehensively.

Abstract
- Perhaps define in a few words the meaning of "dead zones" in this context:
"including dead zones, has not been verified."->
"including dead zones, regions that are magnetically inactive where viscosity
is greatly reduced, has not been verified."

- It could be specified that the experiment (i) refers to bumps in the radial
direction:
"of artificial density bumps"->"of artificial radial density bumps"

Section 2
- line 9, second column:
"We use both spherical co-ordinates r = (r,θ,φ) and cylindrical co-ordinates"
It is not clear from the description of the simulations in sections 4 and 5, in
which cases each type of co-ordinates were used. It would be useful to have
that information summarized in Tables 1 and 2 if possible with a short
discussion in the text describing why a particular co-ordinate system was
chosen for various experiments.

- line 9, second column:
"three-dimensional, isothermal,"->"three-dimensional, locally isothermal,"

Section 2.1
- line 18, first column.
I think it would be good to show a plot of the surface density bump function as
a function of radial distance described in eq. 10 for the parameters used in
the disc models introduced in section 4 using different line styles. This would
give the reader an idea of how this function compares with the shape of the
edge of a gap opened up by a giant planet.

Section 3
- line 17, second column:
Perhaps here also refer to the FARGO algorithm paper (Masset 2000):
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000A%26AS..141..165M

The last paragraph in section 3 could be reworded to make clear which boundary
conditions are applied on each coordinates. What are the conditions for z
boundaries in the case of cylindrical coordinates?

Section 3.1.1
- line 38, second column:
"and and the nonaxisymmetric" -> "and the nonaxisymmetric"

Section 5:
- line 15:
"disappears vortex after"->"disappears after"

Section 6.1
- line  6, second column:
"Pierens & Nelson"->"Pierens & Nelson (2010)"

- line  19, second column:
"Oishi & Mac Low"->"Oishi & Mac Low (2009)"
