However, one concern with these results is that there seems to be a
discrepancy between the effect of layered viscosity in disks with an artificial
bump and realistic models where a gap is opened by a planet. As outlined in
section 4.4 a simulation with a high viscosity layer and an artificial density
bump shows that vorticity increases for a larger upper viscous layer possibly
due to the artificial viscosity radial profile. I think this issue could be
addressed in Section 6 after the two sets of numerical simulations have been
presented. To try to identify why this behavior is present in the vortex
evolution with a prescribed radial viscosity profile, two models with the same
numerical setup and viscosity profile parameters with a density bump and a gap
introduced by the planet could be compared directly.  This comparison could
confirm the hypothesis that the viscosity profile supports the grow of
vorticity if the same effect is reproduced in the simulation that includes the
interaction with a planet.
****************************************************************************************
I have performed additional simulations with artificial density bumps but using  
a radially-smooth viscosity profile. This is described in Appendix A (to minimise 
interruption to the original text) where it is compared to a corresponding case with 
a radially-structured viscosity profile. The vortex is sustained in the latter case 
whereas it decays away when the viscosity profile is radially smooth.  

A radially-structured viscosity profile is necessary to keep a radial density bump 
in steady state. However, this is not required for a gap maintained by
disc-planet interaction. It is not obvious how to choose a radially-structured viscosity profile for 
disc-planet systems to make it comparable to simulations with an artificial 
radial density bump. One possibility is to assume a relation between a gap density and 
viscosity profiles (e.g. nu*Sigma = constant, so that viscosity is lower at the gap 
edge relative to that at the gap centre). Specifying nu=nu(R,z) is not trivial in this case
because the gap density profile depends on the imposed viscosity, so there is
no simple analytical expression for nu.  
One could allow the viscosity to dynamically respond to the  
evolving density field as the planet opens a gap. Such simulations  
are being  prepared for future work, as stated in Section 6.2. Even then, it is not clear 
how a disc-planet case is equivalent to a radial density bump case. 

The primary motivation for using the radially-structured viscosity
profile is to permit a well-defined linear instability (i.e. a
non-evolving background). The difference in the non-linear regime 
between disc-planet simulations and a radial density bump is not
unexpected. The imposed radially-structured viscosity can 
help the instability by sourcing the required disc structure. On the other hand, if
viscosity is radially-smooth, it only acts to damp the instability (as it occurs
for disc-planet simulations and that in Appendix A). 

The experiment described above is a simple alternative that still
supports the hypothesis that a radially-structured viscosity profile
helps the RWI in the non-linear regime.

Abstract
- Perhaps define in a few words the meaning of "dead zones" in this context:
"including dead zones, has not been verified."->
"including dead zones, regions that are magnetically inactive where viscosity
is greatly reduced, has not been verified."
****************************************************************************************
Done. 
****************************************************************************************

- It could be specified that the experiment (i) refers to bumps in the radial
direction:
"of artificial density bumps"->"of artificial radial density bumps"
****************************************************************************************
Done.

Section 2
- line 9, second column:
"We use both spherical co-ordinates r = (r,θ,φ) and cylindrical co-ordinates"
It is not clear from the description of the simulations in sections 4 and 5, in
which cases each type of co-ordinates were used. It would be useful to have
that information summarized in Tables 1 and 2 if possible with a short
discussion in the text describing why a particular co-ordinate system was
chosen for various experiments.
****************************************************************************************
All numerical simulations are performed in spherical
co-ordinates. However, cylindrical co-ordinates are used to describe
the disc models and in results analysis. This is now clarified. 
(It is also mentioned in Section 3, paragraph 3.)

Section 2.1
- line 18, first column.
I think it would be good to show a plot of the surface density bump function as
a function of radial distance described in eq. 10 for the parameters used in
the disc models introduced in section 4 using different line styles. This would
give the reader an idea of how this function compares with the shape of the
edge of a gap opened up by a giant planet.
****************************************************************************************
I thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Instead of the surface density,
I have chosen to plot the potential vorticity profile instead, since this is the
key quantity associated with the RWI. The PV profile for the artificial bump is shown in
Fig. 2, while that for a planet gap is shown in Fig. 7.

****************************************************************************************
Added.
****************************************************************************************

The last paragraph in section 3 could be reworded to make clear which boundary
conditions are applied on each coordinates. What are the conditions for z
boundaries in the case of cylindrical coordinates?
****************************************************************************************
As stated above, all numerical simulations and therefore boundary conditions are 
done in spherical co-ordinates.
