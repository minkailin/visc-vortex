However,  one concern with these results is that there seems to be a
discrepancy between the effect of layered viscosity in disks with an artificial
bump and realistic models where a gap is opened by a planet. As outlined in
section 4.4 a simulation with a high viscosity layer and an artificial density
bump shows that vorticity increases for a larger upper viscous layer possibly
due to the artificial viscosity radial profile. I think this issue could be
addressed in Section 6 after the two sets of numerical simulations have been
presented. To try to identify why this behavior is present in the vortex
evolution with a prescribed radial viscosity profile, two models with the same
numerical setup and viscosity profile parameters with a density bump and a gap
introduced by the planet could be compared directly.  This comparison could
confirm the hypothesis that the viscosity profile supports the grow of
vorticity if the same effect is reproduced in the simulation that includes the
interaction with a planet.
****************************************************************************************
I have performed additional simulations with artificial density bumps but using  
a radially-smooth viscosity profile. This is described in Appendix A (to minimise 
interruption to the original text) where it is compared to a corresponding case with 
a radially-structured viscosity profile. The vortex is sustained in the latter case 
(in fact its amplitude eventually begins to increase in the non-linear regime) whereas
it decays away when the viscosity profile is radially smooth.  


A radially-structured viscosity profile is neccessary to keep a radial density bump 
in steady state. However, this is not required for a gap maintained by disc-planet interaction. 
It is not obvious how to choose a radially-structured viscosity profile for 
disc-planet systems to make it comparable to simulations with an artificial 
radial density bump. One possibility is to assume a relation between a gap density and 
viscosity profiles (e.g. nu*Sigma = constant, so that viscosity is lower at the gap 
edge relative to that at the gap centre).  Specifying nu=nu(R,z) is not trivial in this case
because (i) there is no simple analytical descriptions of a gap profile, and (ii) the gap profile itself
depend on the imposed viscosity. One could allow the viscosity dynamically respond to the 
evolving density field as the planet opens a gap. Such simulations  
are being  prepared for future work, as stated in Section 6.2. Even then, it is not clear 
how a disc-planet case is equivalent to a radial density bump case. 

These additional complications are beyond the scope o.  
The primary motivation for using the radial density bump with a radially-structured
viscosity profile was to permit a well-defined linear instability. Vorticity growth in
the non-linear regime is somewhat artificial 



The experiment described above, is a simpler alternative that 
empiracaly supports the hypothesis that a radially structured viscosity 
profile helps the RWI.

Abstract
- Perhaps define in a few words the meaning of "dead zones" in this context:
"including dead zones, has not been verified."->
"including dead zones, regions that are magnetically inactive where viscosity
is greatly reduced, has not been verified."

Done.

direction:

Section 2
- line 9, second column:
"We use both spherical co-ordinates r = (r,θ,φ) and cylindrical co-ordinates"
It is not clear from the description of the simulations in sections 4 and 5, in
which cases each type of co-ordinates were used. It would be useful to have
that information summarized in Tables 1 and 2 if possible with a short
discussion in the text describing why a particular co-ordinate system was
chosen for various experiments.
****************************************************************************************
All numerical simulations are performed in spherical co-ordinates. However, it was convenient
to describe the disc models and present results in cylindrical co-ordinates. This is now clarified. 
(It is also mentioned in Section 3, paragraph 3.)

I think it would be good to show a plot of the surface density bump function as
a function of radial distance described in eq. 10 for the parameters used in
the disc models introduced in section 4 using different line styles. This would
give the reader an idea of how this function compares with the shape of the
edge of a gap opened up by a giant planet.
****************************************************************************************
I thank the reviewer for this suggestion. Instead of the surface density,
I have chosen to plot the potential vorticity profile instead, since this is the
key quantity associated with the RWI. The PV profile for the artificial bump is shown in
Fig. 2, while that for a planet gap is shown in Fig. .
